# Project Descriptions:

Cafe:
The purpose of the Cafe project is to allow workers at the Cafe to add new items to the menu, display them, and delete them. Each menu item has a meal number, a meal name, a description, and a price.

Claims:

The Claims project allows claims agents to add claims to the queue, view a list of all claims, and remove a claim from the queue once the claim has been completed. The user can also see if a claim is valid or not due to the time between the incident and the day that the claim is made.
